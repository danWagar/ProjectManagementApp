ManageLazily enables company owners, project managers, and employees to have a one-stop
project management hub where they can create projects, track project completion and due dates, 
add tasks to projects, log hours worked on project tasks, and more. Built with simplicity 
and usability in mind, ManageLazily is a great alternative to more complex (and expensive) 
project management software.
