# ManageLazily

> A project management application built with small businesses in mind. Users can create, 
update, assign, track, and analyze their businesses projects securely on the cloud from 
any location with access to the web.


ManageLazily enables company owners, project managers, and employees to have a one-stop
project management hub where they can create projects, track project completion and due dates, 
add tasks to projects, log hours worked on project tasks, and more. Built with simplicity 
and usability in mind, ManageLazily is a great alternative to more complex (and expensive) 
project management software.
